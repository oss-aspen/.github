# Welcome

Project Aspen, previously known as Sandiego, will glean information from open source-ecosystem data sets that can help drive community- 
and business-oriented decision making. Using data-analysis tools built by OSPO, as well as community metric tools from Project CHAOSS, 
Aspen will enable contributors and participants to ask questions and make data-informed decisions about open source projects and communities.

Project Aspen is broken into two different repositories. 

# 8knot (Explorer) 

This is the repository for 8knot, a Dash based visualization platform. The goal of this application is to serve Open Source community mangers, 
stakeholders, contributors, and enthusiasts by providing an insightful and convenient interface to the Open Source project data set collected by 
the project Augur (CHAOSS).

# Rappel 

This is the home for all exploritory data analysis work that goes behind all visualizations and research we create.
